# TopoLines: Topological Smoothing for Line Charts


## Abstract

We present a comprehensive framework for evaluating line chart smoothing methods under a variety of visual analytics tasks. Line charts are commonly used to visualize a series of data samples. When the number of samples is large, or the data are noisy, smoothing can be applied to make the signal more apparent. However, there are a wide variety of smoothing techniques available, and the effectiveness of each depends upon both nature of the data and the visual analytics task at hand. To date, the visualization community lacks a summary work for analyzing and classifying the various smoothing methods available. In this paper, we establish a framework, based on 8 measures of the line smoothing effectiveness tied to 8 low-level visual analytics tasks. We then analyze 12 methods coming from 4 commonly used classes of line chart smoothing---rank filters, convolutional filters, frequency domain filters, and subsampling. The results show that while no method is ideal for all situations, certain methods, such as Gaussian filters and Topology-based subsampling, perform well in general. Other methods, such as low-pass cutoff filters and Douglas-Peucker subsampling, perform well for specific visual analytics tasks. Almost as importantly, our framework demonstrates that several methods, including the commonly used uniform subsampling, produce low-quality results, and should, therefore, be avoided, if possible.


## To run the demo:

We have tested this setup on Mac, Linux, and Windows 11 distributions. 

### [required] Install python3, python3-virtualenv, and git

    On Debian linux, such as Ubuntu
    > sudo apt install python3 python3-virtualenv git

    On Mac, you can download from python.org, macports, or homebrew. You will need python3, python3-virtualenv, pip, git, ... maybe others 

    On Windows, you can just download Python3 from python.org or the Windows Store.


### [required] Run setup process

    This process will setup a virtual environment and install all prerequisites (Mac/Linux).
    > ./run.sh
    
    Everything should be installed and the code will run. If everything goes as planned, a web browser will be opened automatically for you when everything is done. If it doesn't, you can open a web browser and go to http://localhost:3550/.

    Run the code (Windows)
    > Run setup.bat
    > Run run.bat
