# Mapper on Graphs: Homology-Preserving Multi-scale Graph Skeletonization Using Mapper

## Abstract

Graphs are an exceedingly popular type of data for representing relationships between individuals, businesses, proteins, brain regions, telecommunication endpoints, etc. Graph visualization provides an intuitive way to explore the node-link structures of data for sense-making. However, node-link diagrams can fail to convey insights regarding graph structures, even for moderately sized data of a few hundred nodes. We propose to apply the *mapper* construction---a popular tool in topological data analysis---to graph visualization, which provides a strong theoretical basis for summarizing the data while preserving their core structures. We develop a variation of the mapper construction targeting weighted, undirected graphs, called mapper on graphs, which generates property-preserving skeletons of graphs. We further show how the adjustment of a single parameter enables multi-scale skeletonization of the input graph. We provide a software tool that enables interactive explorations of such skeletons and demonstrates the effectiveness of our method for synthetic and real-world data. The mapper on graphs approach we propose represents a new class of techniques that leverages tools from topological data analysis in addressing challenges in graph visualization.
